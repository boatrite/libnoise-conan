A Conan package for libnoise based on [qknight/libnoise](https://github.com/qknight/libnoise)

I very quickly threw this together for personal use, and it isn't published
anywhere. To use, you should be able to clone the repo and run the commands in
the section below.

---

Use `conan create . demo/testing` to test that it works. To open the images
generated by the command, find them in: `test_package/build/<some sort of build number>/bin/texturesphere.bmp`, etc.

Use `conan export-pkg .` to make it available to install on your system.

To use, put `libnoise-conan/0.1@demo/testing` in your conanfile.txt.
